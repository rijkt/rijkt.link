## Hello, world

Obligatory hello, world post. Welcome to my personal website, that I will use for dumping thoughts about programming, linux and whatever else I find interesting. This should be something like a personal knowledge graph, but presentable enough for other people to look at. For example, I will write some documentation about how I set this up. This is mainly for my sake, but might help someone else in the future.

So yeah, this is a first draft and subject to change.
