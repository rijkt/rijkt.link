My name is Pascal and I'm a software engineer, programming language enthusiast and Linux stan. I'm interested in properties of distributed systems, including but not limited to databases. Containers and how to run them in production are my jam.  For learning more about those topics I'm always on the lookout for a hobby project and sparkly new tech to play with.

Besides computers I'm also into reading and writing. I want to spend more time refining my notes and connecting them in a useful way, hence this website. This should become something like a personal knowledge graph that's presentable enough to be useful to other people.
